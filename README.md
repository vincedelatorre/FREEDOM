> A unified platform for orchestrating robots and factory infrastructure.

## Introduction
FREEDOM is a fleet management and orchestration platform for AMRs and other transport robots, designed to seamlessly coordinate robot operations with plant infrastructure systems.
In addition to typical Warehouse Control System (WCS) capabilities, FREEDOM provides the following features:

- **Unified Portal**  
   By integrating various robot APIs, FREEDOM enables control of multiple robot types with different coordinate systems. FREEDOM provides a unified dashboard that visualizes the status of all equipment in real time, improving operational efficiency for on-site workers.
- **Job Creator**  
   Users can create a sequence (job) consisting of multiple tasks via the Web UI, enabling on-site workers to independently implement Kaizen (continuous improvement).
- **Infrastructure-linked zones**  
   Users can draw zones on the Web UI that are linked to internal traffic infrastructure devices such as signal lamps or shutters, specifying where these devices should be triggered. This function makes on-site adjustment easier.

## Who is this for?
- Factory automation engineers
- Robotics system integrators
- Developers building Warehouse Control Systems (WCS) and robotics platforms

## Terminology
This project defines the following terms to avoid ambiguity.

- **Repository**  
   A logical unit representing a functional category within FREEDOM.
   It corresponds to the directory structure `backend/src/<repository>/`.  
   This concept is inspired by the Repository pattern used in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture, and is defined as a unit for grouping related functionality.  
   The five repositories are: `freedom`, `job`, `robot`, `infrastructure`, and `equipment`.

- **Node**  
   An execution unit (service or functional module) with a specific responsibility.
   It corresponds to the directory structure `backend/src/<repository>/<node>/`.  
   For example, `backend/src/robot/dummy` represents the `dummy` node that belongs to the `robot` repository.

**Note:**  
The term "repository" in this project does **not** refer to a GitHub repository (a remote code management unit), but rather to a functional category within FREEDOM.  
While the concept is inspired by the Repository pattern in DDD and Clean Architecture, it does not represent a data access layer itself.  
In this README, when referring to a repository hosted on GitHub, the term **"GitHub repository"** will be used explicitly.

## System Architecture
FREEDOM follows a microservices architecture and is composed of multiple nodes (services), each with an independent function.
Each node must belong to exactly one “repository” (functional category). In terms of directory layout, a node is located at `backend/src/<repository>/<node>/`.

For example, to integrate your new AMR into FREEDOM, you need to implement a custom node that contains the AMR’s API commands and place it under the `robot` repository (`backend/src/robot/<your_amr_node>`).
- [freedom](backend/src/freedom) - Core program of FREEDOM (`freedom` repository)
- [job](backend/src/job) - Job creation and execution (`job` repository)
- [robot](backend/src/robot) - Robot control (`robot` repository)
- [infrastructure](backend/src/infrastructure) - Internal traffic infrastructure control (`infrastructure` repository)
- [equipment](backend/src/equipment) - Plant equipment integration (`equipment` repository)
